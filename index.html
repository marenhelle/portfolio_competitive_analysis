		<p>Clean, colorful and fresh. I believe that the site in a successfull manner manages to stand out from most portfolios.
		It is consistent in its design and easy to understand. </p>
	    <h5>Functionality</h5>
		<p>La Moulade shows off its content in a clear manner. Buttons could have been bigger to ease the navigation. It takes time to understand and get to the different pages,
		although there is a meny top right.</p>
	    <h5>Interactivity</h5>
		<p>There is a wide use of transitions on the page. As you scroll down, different things are presented, as the company's services and portfolio.
		The navigation of the page might appear confusing, but this is balanced bay a simple graphical profile. The user is only in control of the scrolling,
		and is not able to choose between different sorting.</p>
	    <h5>Navigation</h5>
		<p>At first it was difficult to understand the navigation concept of the page. It took some time before I figured that I was to scroll down to see the whole page.
		After I had used the page for some time, I felt like I got an overview of the system-architecture. At the first glance the layout may look like the 'Advanced Grid',
		but as one starts to scroll down, the navigation is quite unique.</p>

	    <h5>Functionality</h5>
		<p>you should talk about whether it effectively shows off what needs to be shown.  If it is site with details can you see the details.
		Are there enough secondary pages showing off the design?  Should there be annotations or commentary.  Functionality can blur into navigation at times.</p>
	    <h5>Interactivity</h5>
		<p>you should mention and show the sort of interactivity on the site.
		Do they use coverflow, lightbox and if so how elegantly?  Do they allow sorting, categorizing (again this is like navigation)</p>
	    <h5>Navigation</h5>
		<p>for us will mean getting around different pages.  When you are on a different page do you know where you are,
		how to get back, what the page is, what else there is</p>
