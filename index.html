	    <h4>Brand</h4>
		<p>Clean, colorful and fresh. I believe that the site in a successfull manner manages to stand out from most portfolios.
		It is consistent in its design and easy to understand. </p>
	    <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>La Moulade shows off its content in a clear manner. Buttons could have been bigger to ease the navigation. It takes time to understand and get to the different pages,
		although there is a meny top right.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>There is a wide use of transitions on the page. As you scroll down, different things are presented, as the company's services and portfolio.
		The navigation of the page might appear confusing, but this is balanced bay a simple graphical profile. The user is only in control of the scrolling,
		and is not able to choose between different sorting.</p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>At first it was difficult to understand the navigation concept of the page. It took some time before I figured that I was to scroll down to see the whole page.
		After I had used the page for some time, I felt like I got an overview of the system-architecture. At the first glance the layout may look like the 'Advanced Grid',
		but as one starts to scroll down, the navigation is quite unique.</p>

	    <h4>Brand</h4>
		<p>Kyle Steed's webpage has a clear identity and personality. You get a defined impression of the artist and his works by looking at the home page.
		It can be described as toned down (colorwise), personal and structured.  </p>
	     <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>The portfolio is very understandable. Buttons are big and the page is lucid. There are no small details on the page and the identity is throughout.
		The page does not consist of many pages, but it seems to be suffient for navigation.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>Other than clickable pictures as links, there are little interactivity. It is however easy to understand where to click. The only thing that I notice,
		is that the pictures on each project's page are clickable, but they don't link to anything.</p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>It is easy to get an overview of the page and navigate between the different projects. 'Blog' and 'Shop'open in new windows when links are clicked,
		and this seems unnecessary. The layout is similar to 'Headline & Gallery'.</p>

</table>
	    <h4>Brand</h4>
		<p>Calm, simple and clean. Colors are well suited for the 'homemade' drawings. There could have been more structure on the site as it feels like everything is 'floating around'.
		The page has a clear and cosistent style throughout all pages.</p>
	    <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>At the first glance the page looks very professional, but the impression fades as I go through the different pages. The functionality varies a lot throughout the pages.
		Some links does not lead anywhere. The meny can overlap some of the text when scrolling, which looks unprofessional.
		There are items on the pages that does not seem to have any function. Some of the text is difficult to read as it appears as a small grey text. The pictures in the portfolio
		should have been clickable as the pictures shown are too small to get a good impression. </p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>In the background circles are moving around seemingly for no reason. Several places there are mouse-over interactions, where information or menues appear. </p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>The menu is easy to see and comprehend, which makes it simple to get to the different pages and get an understanding of the
		system architecture. I have no problem finding my way from the home page to e.g. the portfolio. It can however be difficult to understand what images are clickable.
		The layout resembles 'Featured Graphic' with slight modifications.</p>

</table>
	    <h4>Brand</h4>
		<p>Fun, calm and clean. The picture, colors and text are all in a childish manner. This is an obvious statement from the design team on how they want their product
		'Little Printer' to be percieved, as fun and easy to use.</p>
	     <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>The page is easy to use and navigate. I get the necessary information I need, and not more.
		The page could benefit on having 'shorter' pages, with less scrolling down.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>Links are made as buttons where one can see it being pressed down as on a physical object. This is an interesting and fun feature.
		Otherwise the Berg Cloud-page consists of little interactivity, something that matches well with the graphical identity as a bit 'old school'.</p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>Navigating through the different pages are easy, the menu are fixed on top and in a contrasting color. The layout can be said to be a modification of 'Featured Graphic'
		where the graphic is a picture of the 'Little Printer'. It can also resemble 'Three Boxes' where the boxes are reversed.</p>

</table>
	    <h4>Brand</h4>
		<p>Structured, technical and colorful. This is the portfolio of an architectural company, and on the front page the different projects are illustrated by small
		icons in different colors. The font is technical and there's only a minimum of text. The icons makes the page look complicated,
		but because the layout is very strict, with black text on white background, the overall impression of the page is organized.   </p>
	    <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>The page is very functional and simple, although the icons makes it more complex. The menu bar is fixed at the bottom on the home page,
		but changes to be left aligned when the 'Info'-button is pressed. The overall impression of the page is that it is very tidy and structured.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>Transitions between the different pages are fast, supporting the simple and technical identity.
		The page allows the user to choose between four different categories, that change the order of the icons. </p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>Because the portfolio is so structured, it is quite easy to understand the hierarchy of the different pages. The layout does not resemble any of
		the layout examples from Design Shack. </p>

		<p>Fun, childish and colorful. The page takes use of a lot of humour and illustrations which makes the page fun, although the underlying issues are highly technical.
		The page has a very clear personality, friendly and supporting.
		</p>
	     <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>The page is highly functional and easy to use. The menu is fixed both on top and bottom. Icons are used more than text to illustrate the different functions.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>There is little use of interactivity on the page. Text is highlighted when clicked. </p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>The page is easy to navigate. Because the menu bar is fixed, it is easy to come from one side to another. The layout can be interpreted as a modification of
		the advanced grid</p>

		<p>Honest, simple and clean. Only a minimum of text, written in sans-serif. Projects are only presented by pictures on the front page. </p>
	    <h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>The front page is highly functional and easy to understand. However, the menu disappears on some of the pages. From the 'Shop' page you
		have to either open a new window or use the back-button to get back to the front page.</p>
	    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
		<p>There is very little use of interactive elements.
		Pictures are used as link on the front page and on the project page the pictures will slide horisontally.</p>
	    <h4>Navigation</h4>
		<p>This page represent a typical 'Advanced Grid' with pictures vertically structured. The navigation is easy from page to page.</p>
